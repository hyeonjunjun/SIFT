# EAS Ignore - Controls what files are uploaded to EAS Build servers
# Unlike .gitignore, we want to INCLUDE our locally generated sensitive config files
# so that EAS has them during the build process, even if they aren't in Git.

# dependencies
node_modules/

# Expo
.expo/
dist/
web-build/
expo-env.d.ts

# Native

# macOS

# local env files

# generated native folders

/android

# NOTE: We DO NOT ignore GoogleService-Info.plist and google-services.json here!
# This allows them to be sent to EAS even though they are in .gitignore.
